## 1. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

### First-Line: Stimulants (for ADHD-related WM deficits)

#### Methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta/Addwize)
- **Mechanism:** Blocks DA/NE reuptake in PFC → improves WM via D1 + alpha-2A receptors
- **Adult dosage:** Start 18mg, titrate by 18mg/week, target 36-54mg, max 72mg/day
- **WM improvement:** d=0.26-0.74; effects within HOURS of correct dose
- **Key insight:** Improves WM efficiency/manipulation, NOT raw digit span capacity
- **India:** Addwize (Sun), Inspiral (Intas) - Schedule X, INR 108-167/strip
- **Side effects:** Insomnia, appetite suppression, nervousness, tachycardia

#### Amphetamine Salts (Adderall/Vyvanse)
- **Mechanism:** Increases synaptic DA/NE via reuptake block + vesicular release + transporter reversal
- **Vyvanse:** Start 20-30mg, titrate 10-20mg/week, max 70mg. Duration 10-14 hrs.
- **Adderall XR:** 10-30mg daily, ~12 hrs
- **WM:** Similar to MPH; Vyvanse steadier PFC dopamine release
- **India:** NOT AVAILABLE (amphetamines not approved in India)

### Second-Line: Non-Stimulants

#### Atomoxetine (Strattera/Axepta/Attentrol)
- **Mechanism:** Selective NE reuptake inhibitor; also increases PFC dopamine
- **Dosage:** Start 40mg, target 80mg after 3 days, max 100mg
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for some improvement, **4-6 weeks for full effect**, d=0.82 by month 6
- **India:** Widely available (NOT controlled substance), INR 100-400/month
- **Best when:** Stimulant supply irregular, abuse risk, comorbid anxiety

#### Guanfacine (Intuniv)
- **Mechanism:** Alpha-2A agonist in PFC → strengthens network connectivity
- **Dosage:** 2-6mg/day extended-release
- **WM data:** Does NOT improve WM alone; best as ADJUNCT to stimulant (+0.28 SD combined)
- **India:** LIMITED availability
- **Side effects:** Somnolence, hypotension. Do NOT stop abruptly.

### Supplements WITH Evidence

| Supplement | WM Evidence | Dosage | Time to Effect |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Omega-3 (EPA+DHA)** | Moderate (general cognition) | 2000mg/day | 8-12 weeks |
| **Bacopa monnieri** | Moderate (especially elderly) | 300-600mg (45% bacosides) | 8-12 weeks |
| **Creatine** | Emerging (sleep-deprived/stressed) | 3-5g/day | 2-4 weeks |
| **Phosphatidylserine** | Weak-moderate | 300mg/day | 6-12 weeks |
| **L-theanine + caffeine** | Weak (attention, not WM) | 100-200mg + 50-100mg | Acute |

### Supplements WITHOUT Evidence (AVOID):
- Ginkgo biloba, Prevagen, racetams, "brain pill" stacks, vinpocetine

## 2. NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS

### Exercise Protocol (Strongest Non-Drug Evidence)
- **Type:** Aerobic (running, cycling, swimming, HIIT)
- **Duration:** 20-45 min/session
- **Frequency:** 5-7 days/week
- **Program length:** 13-24 weeks for maximal effects
- **Effect:** HIIT SMD=0.38 for executive function; Aerobic g=0.80 in sedentary adults
- **Acute:** Even single 20-min walk improves WM for 1-2 hours

### Sleep Optimization (Highest ROI)
- **Target:** 7-9 hours, consistent schedule (including weekends)
- **Impact of deprivation:** WM accuracy g=-0.555 (medium-large deficit)
- **Protocol:** Cool room (18-20C), no screens 1hr before bed, no caffeine after 2PM, morning light 10-15min
- **Sleep apnea:** Get sleep study if suspected - CPAP reverses WM deficits

### Mindfulness Meditation
- **Type:** Focused attention (concentrate on breath) - better for WM than open monitoring
- **Duration:** 13-20 min/day minimum
- **Program:** 8 weeks for measurable N-back improvement
- **Effect:** g=0.438 (medium)

### Neurostimulation
- **tDCS:** Anodal over left DLPFC, 2mA, 20min + concurrent WM training
- **Combined effect:** SMD=0.72 at 10+ sessions (persists 1 year)
- **Availability:** Research centers, some specialty clinics. Consumer devices NOT recommended unsupervised.

## 3. TREATMENT ALGORITHMS

### PATH A: ADHD Diagnosed

**Tier 1 (Week 1-4):**
1. Stimulant medication trial (MPH or amphetamine)
2. Sleep optimization (immediate)
3. Exercise 30min moderate aerobic 5x/week
4. External support systems (calendars, lists, timers)

**Tier 2 (Month 1-3):**
5. CBT for ADHD (organizational strategies)
6. WM training 5x/week, 30-45min
7. Mindfulness meditation 15min/day
8. Mediterranean diet + omega-3 2000mg/day

**Tier 3 (Month 3-6, if needed):**
9. Add guanfacine to stimulant (combination)
10. Or switch to atomoxetine (allow 6 weeks)
11. Consider: Bacopa 300mg, creatine 5g/day
12. Consider: tDCS if available

### PATH B: No ADHD

**Tier 1 (Week 1-4):**
1. Rule out: Sleep apnea, thyroid, B12, iron, depression
2. Sleep optimization
3. Exercise 30-45min aerobic 5-7x/week
4. Hydration 2-3L/day
5. External support systems

**Tier 2 (Month 1-3):**
6. WM training program 5x/week
7. Mindfulness 15-20min/day
8. Mediterranean diet + omega-3 + B-vitamins + vitamin D
9. Cognitive engagement (new skills, challenging reading)

**Tier 3 (Month 3-6):**
10. Bacopa 300mg, creatine 5g/day
11. tDCS if clinically available
12. Re-evaluate: Could ADHD be present?

## 4. TREATMENT TIMELINE

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Stimulant (if Rx): Noticeable WM improvement within hours of correct dose
- Sleep: Modest improvements within days
- Exercise: Acute boost after each session

### Month 1: Optimization
- Stimulant dose optimized (2-4 weeks titration)
- Atomoxetine: Some improvement beginning (NOT full effect yet)
- Exercise habit established

### Month 3: Integration
- Atomoxetine: Approaching full effect
- WM training: Near-transfer gains apparent
- Exercise: Chronic adaptation effects
- Meditation: WM improvements measurable
- **Expect: 0.3-0.5 SD improvement on WM measures (combined effects)**

### Month 6: Consolidation
- Atomoxetine: d=0.82 at 80mg
- WM training: Maximum gains, shift to maintenance
- All interventions: Synergistic effects established
- **Functional: Noticeably better at multitasking, reading, conversation tracking**

### If Plateau:
1. Re-assess for untreated comorbidity
2. Switch medication class
3. Change WM training paradigm
4. Add neurostimulation
5. Shift focus to compensatory strategies
6. Neuropsychological re-evaluation

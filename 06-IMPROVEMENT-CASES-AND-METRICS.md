## 1. COGNITIVE TRAINING RESULTS (Hard Numbers)

### Cogmed Working Memory Training

**Klingberg et al., 2005 (Landmark RCT)**
- N=53 children with ADHD, ages 7-12, 5 weeks daily training
- Visuospatial WM (Span Board): Significant at post-test AND 3-month follow-up

### N-Back Training

**Jaeggi et al., 2008 (The study that started it all)**
- N=70 healthy adults, 8-19 days of dual N-back
- Fluid intelligence improvement: **d=0.65** vs controls
- Dose-response: More training days = more improvement
- Source: [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0801268105)

**Thompson et al., 2016 (Detailed N-back progression)**
- N=57 adults, 5 weeks, ~22.75 sessions
- Starting N-back level: **1.99** (essentially 2-back)
- Ending N-back level: **3.29** (essentially 3-back)
- 52% reached 4-back; 26% reached 5-back; 15% reached 6-back
- Statistical transfer to other WM tasks: **NONE** (Bayesian odds 4.8:1 to 40:1 favoring null)

### COGITO Study (Max Planck Institute - Gold Standard)
- N=204 (101 younger 20-31, 103 older 65-80), **100+ daily sessions over 6 months**
- Effect sizes on practiced WM tasks:

| Task | Younger Adults (d) | Older Adults (d) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Alpha Span | 1.08 | 1.36 |
| Memory Updating | 1.20 | 0.98 |
| N-Back Figural | 0.90 | 1.46 |

- Near-transfer to WM (latent): d=0.36 (younger), d=0.31 (older)
- Long-term: Transfer to reasoning maintained 2 years later

### Melby-Lervag et al., 2016 (THE Definitive Meta-Analysis)
- **87 publications, 145 comparisons** - the final word on WM training transfer

| Outcome | vs Active Controls (g) | vs Passive Controls (g) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Trained tasks | 0.80 | 1.88 |
| Verbal WM (near) | **0.31** | 0.42 |
| Visuospatial WM (near) | **0.28** | 0.51 |
| Fluid Intelligence (far) | **0.05** (NULL) | 0.20 |
| Reading Comprehension | 0.15 | 0.12 |
| Arithmetic | 0.06 | 0.12 |

**Bottom line: Robust near-transfer (g=0.28-0.31), ZERO far-transfer when proper controls used.**

## 2. MEDICATION IMPACT ON WORKING MEMORY

### Methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta)

**Bolden et al., 2021 (ADHD Children)**
- N=35, ages 7-12, mean 19.59mg
- Placebo WM: 2.55 correct/trial → MPH WM: 2.79 correct/trial
- **d=0.74** (medium-large)
- Higher WM load → bigger effect: d=0.66 at standard load, **d=1.17** at high load
- Source: [PMC8406432](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8406432/)

**Meta-analytic (chronic):** g=0.34-0.59 across cognitive domains

### Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)
- Executive Function Composite: mean change **-17.9** (p<0.0001) in 308 children
- PERMP Task: LDX=133.3 vs placebo=88.2 — **51% improvement**

### Guanfacine (Intuniv)

- Combined (MPH + Guanfacine): +0.28 SD
- Guanfacine ALONE: -0.07 SD (no WM improvement alone)

## 3. NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

### Aerobic Exercise

- Meeting 150+ min/week guidelines: **g=1.21** (p=0.008)

## 5. COMBINED INTERVENTIONS (Best Outcomes)

| Intervention | WM Effect Size | Sustained? |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| tDCS + Cognitive Training (10+ sessions) | **SMD=0.72** | Up to 1 year |
| Neurofeedback (elderly) | g=0.665 | Limited data |
| MPH in ADHD | d=0.34-0.74 | While medicated |
| Aerobic exercise (older adults) | g=0.39-0.80 | With continued exercise |
| Mindfulness meditation | g=0.438 | Unknown long-term |
| Cogmed near-transfer (verbal) | g=0.31 | g=0.26 at 6 months |
| **Far transfer to intelligence** | **g=0.05** | **NO** |

### Key Takeaway:
**No study has demonstrated moving someone from digit span 4 to 7 through any single intervention.** Typical improvements: 0.3-0.7 SD ≈ 1-2 additional items on span tasks. The best results come from COMBINED approaches (medication + training + exercise + sleep).

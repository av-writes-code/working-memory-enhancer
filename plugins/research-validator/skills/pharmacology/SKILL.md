# Pharmacological Interventions for Working Memory

## First-Line: Stimulants (ADHD-Related WM Deficits)

### Methylphenidate (MPH)

| Property | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Mechanism | Blocks DAT/NET reuptake in PFC → increases synaptic DA/NE → engages D1 + alpha-2A receptors | Arnsten (2011) |
| Brands (India) | Addwize (Sun Pharma), Inspiral (Intas) | Schedule X, INR 108–167/strip |
| Adult dosage | Start 18mg, titrate +18mg/week, target 36–54mg, max 72mg/day | Standard titration protocol |
| WM effect size | **d=0.26–0.74** (acute, ADHD children) | Bolden et al. 2021 (PMC ID pending verification; effect sizes d=0.74 and d=1.17 are from the Bolden/Campez methylphenidate-WM literature) |
| WM at high load | **d=1.17** (high WM load specifically) | Bolden et al. 2021 (PMC ID pending verification) |
| Meta-analytic (chronic) | g=0.34–0.59 across cognitive domains | Various meta-analyses |
| Onset | Hours (correct dose) | Clinical observation |
| Key insight | Improves WM efficiency/manipulation, NOT raw digit span capacity | Consistent across studies |

### Amphetamine Salts

| Property | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Mechanism | Reuptake block + vesicular release + transporter reversal → more sustained DA/NE | Heal et al. (2013) |
| Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) | Start 20–30mg, titrate 10–20mg/week, max 70mg, duration 10–14 hrs | FDA labeling |
| Adderall XR | 10–30mg daily, ~12 hrs | FDA labeling |
| Executive Function | Mean change **-17.9** (BRIEF-P, p<0.0001) in N=308 | PMC2873712 |
| Task performance | LDX=133.3 vs placebo=88.2 (**51% improvement** PERMP) | PMC2873712 |
| **India** | **NOT AVAILABLE** — amphetamines not approved | CDSCO |

## Second-Line: Non-Stimulants

### Atomoxetine (ATX)

| Property | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Mechanism | Selective NE reuptake inhibitor; also increases PFC dopamine (via NET in PFC) | Bymaster et al. (2002) |
| Brands (India) | Axepta, Attentrol — NOT controlled substance, widely available | INR 100–400/month |
| Dosage | Start 40mg, target 80mg after 3 days, max 100mg | Standard protocol |
| Timeline | 1–2 weeks partial; **4–6 weeks full effect**; **d=0.82 by month 6 at 80mg** (d=0.82 is specifically for the 80mg subgroup from open-label extension data, not the blinded RCT phase) | PMC5069588 (Camporeale et al. 2016 pooled analysis) |
| ADHD symptoms | SMD=-0.45 (p<0.00001, N=445, 12 weeks) | PMC5069588 (Camporeale et al. 2016 pooled analysis) |
| Best when | Stimulant supply irregular, abuse risk, comorbid anxiety | Clinical guidelines |

### Guanfacine (Extended-Release)

| Property | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Mechanism | Alpha-2A agonist in PFC → strengthens network connectivity | Arnsten (2011) |
| Dosage | 2–6mg/day extended-release | FDA labeling |
| WM alone | **-0.07 SD (NO improvement alone)** | PMC4964604 |
| Combined (MPH + GXR) | **+0.28 SD** | PMC4964604 |
| India | LIMITED availability | — |
| Warning | Do NOT stop abruptly — rebound hypertension | Clinical requirement |

## Supplements WITH Evidence

| Supplement | WM Evidence Level | Effect | Dosage | Onset | Source |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) | Level I (moderate) | General cognition, not WM-specific | 2000mg/day | 8–12 weeks | Multiple meta-analyses |
| Bacopa monnieri | Level I (moderate, elderly) | Memory consolidation | 300–600mg (45% bacosides) | 8–12 weeks | Kongkeaw et al. (2014) |
| Creatine | Level II (emerging) | Under sleep deprivation/stress | 3–5g/day | 2–4 weeks | Avgerinos et al. (2018) |
| Phosphatidylserine | Level I (weak-moderate) | Cognitive decline in elderly | 300mg/day | 6–12 weeks | Glade & Smith (2015) |
| L-theanine + caffeine | Level II (weak for WM) | Attention, not WM specifically | 100–200mg + 50–100mg | Acute | Haskell et al. (2008) |

## Supplements WITHOUT Evidence (App Must NOT Recommend)

- Ginkgo biloba (Level I meta-analysis: null effect on cognition in healthy adults)
- Prevagen (FTC lawsuit for deceptive advertising)
- Racetams (piracetam, aniracetam — inconsistent evidence, not FDA-approved)
- "Brain pill" stacks (no standardized formulation, no evidence)
- Vinpocetine (insufficient evidence, safety concerns)

## India-Specific Availability

| Drug | Available? | Status | Cost/Month |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Methylphenidate | Yes | Schedule X (prescription only) | INR 300–1,000 |

## Critical Rules for App Content

1. **NEVER recommend specific medications** — only present information for discussion with doctors
2. **ALWAYS include disclaimer**: "Consult a licensed physician before starting any medication"
3. **Dosages are informational** — individual titration by prescriber required
4. **India context**: If user is in India, note amphetamine unavailability; suggest atomoxetine as accessible alternative
5. **Supplement claims**: Use MEDIUM confidence qualifiers at best ("research suggests"), never "proven" or "guaranteed"
